# **Important FY26 Update: POE Script No Longer Required for V8.0 Delivery**

Dear Partners,

We would like to inform you that, starting in FY26, the **POE script is no longer required** for the delivery of version 8.0 of the Data Security Envisioning Workshop. The script will **not be updated** moving forward.

For your reference, the existing script will remain available in this location for **historical purposes** and to support partners who may still need to complete engagements based on the V7 or V7.1 versions of the Data Security Engagement.

You can access the script here:

Thank you for your continued partnership and understanding.
